Many of you are probably aware that one of the great things about Umbraco is the fact that it is easily extendable and can be used for all sorts of flexible solutions. This is mostly down to the community and the people who are constantly building upon a solid foundation. 

It would be a shame for all this great work to go unnoticed and so [Lee Keheller](https://twitter.com/leekelleher) has created a repository that showcases some of these packages and groups them into their use. 

> A collection of awesome Umbraco 7 packages, resources and shiny things.

### Next steps

Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/leekelleher/awesome-umbraco) and add some packages to the list!
