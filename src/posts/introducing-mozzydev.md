It's been a while, but after the launch of [Hylia](https://hylia.website) by Andy Bell, I figured it was about time that I updated my personal site. 

With that, the opportunity for a bit of a refresh arised and so [mozzy.dev](https://mozzy.dev) was born.

## Personal brand

I've not toyed too much with changing my username, it's mostly been `mozzy16` from an early start and then I tried `tcmorris` to give a more professional spin.

The origins of `mozzy16` are rather boring, a play on my surname and my birth date. `tcmorris` was just tied to my name. 

After being called mozzy, moz or mo quite often, it seems appropriate to stay along those lines. This time just with a developer spin, since that's what I do.

## Why is this important?

Here's [some reading](https://codeshare.co.uk/blog/boosting-your-career-by-creating-a-personal-brand/) that you might find of interest from Paul Seal of codeshare.co.uk fame.

Andy tells us his story too: [So long, HankChizlJaw](https://andy-bell.design/wrote/so-long-hankchizljaw/)

## Personal sites

With a personal brand goes a personal site. Sure, you could write on Medium or some other online community, but in doing so you're effectively losing a level of control over your content. If I wanted to change anything on this site, I've got the source code, including all the posts and images that go with it. In migrating from Jekyll, all I needed to do was copy and paste some files.

If you're wanting to start a personal site, perhaps try something like [Hylia](https://hylia.website) as a starting point.
