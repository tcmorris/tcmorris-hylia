Hello.

I am a Bristol based web developer who specialises in [Umbraco]({{ site.umbraco.link }}), Episerver and ASP.NET. I work for a company called [BeerBods](https://beerbods.co.uk/), a beer club and subscription service. Previously, I worked for [Zone](https://www.zonedigital.com/uk/), named as one of the best digital agencies in the UK. 

During that time I have been fortunate to work with clients such as Travelex, Greene King, BMW Group, Swinton, RSPB, British Cycling and Sky to name a few.

Feel free to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mozzy16) or drop me an [email](mailto:hello@tcmorris.net).
