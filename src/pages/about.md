Hello.

I am a Bristol based web developer who specialises in [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/training/certified-developers/developer/?id=6bb58bc7-772d-4d71-99da-b924cb232066), Episerver and ASP.NET. I work for a company called [Manifesto](https://manifesto.co.uk/), a creative tech agency aimed at providing positive change. Previously, I have worked for [BeerBods](https://beerbods.co.uk/), a beer club and subscription service; and before that I worked for [Zone](https://www.zonedigital.com/uk/), named as one of the best digital agencies in the UK. 

With over 10 years of working in the industry, I have been fortunate to work with clients such as Travelex, Greene King, BMW Group, Swinton, RSPB, British Cycling and Sky to name a few.

I'm interested in the future of the web, ensuring that it is an accessible platform for developers and users alike. I like to build solutions with the customer in focus, aiming for the best possible experience with a friendly tone. Even complex problems can appear simple. In some way, the posts that I'll write will be an attempt to provide that outlook.

I help run an Umbraco [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/umBristol/) in Bristol and have done a few [talks](/talks/) at local meetup groups and conferences. When time allows, I try to contribute to open source projects and the wider community as a whole.
